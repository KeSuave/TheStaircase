# TheStaircase

A simple tool to keep track of your progress training under TheStaircase methodology. TheStaircase was originally developed by [JaKaTaK](https://www.twitch.tv/jakataktv).

This is a tool that automatically checks your replays after each game is played and utilizes SQ as a metric for progress. Although SQ is not as good as Spending Skill, it is a good indicator of how good your spending is.

**Note: a few things were modified from the original TheStaircase**
